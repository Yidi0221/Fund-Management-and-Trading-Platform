# Fund-Management-and-Trading-Platform

### Problem Statement
The problems we trying to solve are the difficulties of customers facing to choose funds, the limited knowledge, time or money they have, the lack of professional management and the fear of investment risk.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide great benefit to investors with limited knowledge, time or money, to help customers decide whether funds are best for them and their situation, and to better manage their profitability, using our amazing design. As we can see, since the creation of funds, they have been a popular investment vehicle for investors, the more popular they are, the more challenges they will face. The design we built is try to help customers spread risks across asset classes (such as bonds, cash, property and shares), countries and stock market sectors (such as financials, industrials or retailers), and track their profitability.

### Solution Proposed
We are trying to build a Fund Management & Trading Platform, which is a system using the Ecosystem Model, to collect fund products sold by various fund companies, analyze the historical data of fund products, and recommend the appropriate funds to the investors through strict screening based on the search history and preference of customers, and provide insurance services as well. The Platform will also include the function of comparisons of fund products, using various charts to reveal the differences. In addition, the Platform could display the bank transaction details. Furthermore, the distinguishable funds companies could develop future product launch plans based on the analysis of the transaction details provided by the system.
